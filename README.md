Weather Dashboard

This application was creater for travelers that want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities. When the city name is entered in the input form, the current weather along with future conditions for that city are presented. City name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, the wind speed and UV index are stats that the application will provide. A 5-day is also loaded when a city is searched. A list of previously searched cities is another function this Dashboard provides.
